GENERAL  

- simple tests - blastology   
- simplify gene family file
- add more possvm options
- cluster stats output
- separate log files for phylogeny
- make nicer temporary and output directories
- manage --force and re-running
- Clustering guided by representative sequence alignment and phylogeny
- Sequence reclustering after initial clusters have been built - to include distant homologs in the species of interest

CLUSTERING  
- solve the issue with multiple "cluster" functions - there is one in main and the other one in blastology  
- better iterative clustering handling   
- mmseqs2 clustering - implement iterative clustering   
- move cluster filtering from the main
- MMSeqs clustering should output a canonical clustering file - akin to broccoli and mcl (each cluster per line) => update parsing functions!


BLASTOLOGY  
- check for species prefixes in the provided queries! If these species aren't found in the fasta file, abort!  
- slurm scripts to run blastology 
- add a possibility to extract PFAM domain from blastp hits. Basically, run hmmsearch on the hits   
- MMSeqs clustering should output a canonical clustering file - akin to broccoli and mcl (each cluster per line) => update parsing functions!

EASYPHYLO  
- [x] add an output directory option so that the output files are not written to the directory with inputs  
- [x] get rid of .tree.treefile file names 
- CAVE: iqtree3 now may provide alrt branch support values as well. Need to test whether possvm is able to handle it.

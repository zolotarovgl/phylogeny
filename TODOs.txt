- simplify gene family file
- add more possvm options
- cluster stats output
- separate log files
- move cluster filtering from the main
- make nicer temporary and output directories
- manage --force and re-running
- Clustering guided by representative sequence alignment and phylogeny
- Sequence reclustering after initial clusters have been built - to include distant homologs in the species of interest
- MMSeqs clustering should output a canonical clustering file - akin to broccoli and mcl (each cluster per line) => update parsing functions!


BLASTOLOGY  
- check for species prefixes in the provided queries! If these species aren't found in the fasta file, abort!  
- slurm scripts to run blastology 
- add a possibility to extract PFAM domain from blastp hits. Basically, run hmmsearch on the hits
